Xigadee is a Microservice framework, developed by [Paul Stancer](https://github.com/paulstancer) and [Guy Steel](https://github.com/guysteel) at Hitachi Consulting. The framework has been in development for a number of years, and is based on our experience - and more importantly our pain - in building large-scale distributed cloud applications for our clients. 

The libraries are designed to simplify, and provide a consistent approach to our consulting teams, in building modern applications that target Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) technologies. 

Xigadee is now open-source, released under the Apache 2 license, and you are free to use it within your own commercial applications without restriction. It is built using Microsoft .NET technologies, and has deep integration in to the Azure technology stack. 

## Quick guides

If you are new to Microservice development, then the following link will give you an overview of Microservices and how we would compose a Microservice based application.
* [What is a Microservice?](Xigadee.Platform/_Docs/WhatIsAMicroservice.md)
* [An introduction to Xigadee](Xigadee.Platform/_Docs/Introduction.md)

Or if you want a quick introduction on how to build a new Microservice application using the Xigadee libraries, then read the following:

### Packages

Xigadee is made up of a number of distinct NuGet packages, which are listed below. They support different areas of Microservice functionality. These capabilities can be added to your project through the relevant [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Tags%3A%22Xigadee%22) packages. Currently Xigadee is in a pre-release state, but we are working to complete the documentation, and improve the code test coverage, so that we can provide a base line set of releases.
