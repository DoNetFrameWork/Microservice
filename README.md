Xigadee is a Microservice framework, developed by [Paul Stancer](https://github.com/paulstancer) and [Guy Steel](https://github.com/guysteel) at Hitachi Consulting. 
The framework is based on our experience, and the knowledge gained, 
in building large-scale distributed cloud applications for our clients over the past four years. 

We found when constructing a Microservice based system, that typically much of the work is spent on building and testing the application "plumbing", i.e. messaging, monitoring, communication etc., instead of on the actual application logic. Xigadee's goal is to solve that problem. It provides a consistent approach, and a set of reusable tools, that can be applied to many types of Microservice application.

Xigadee provides a simple declarative programming model to speed up the construction of a Microservice (see the [15-minute Microservice](Src/Xigadee.Platform/_Docs/fifteenminuteMicroservice.md) for details). 
 
The libraries are built using Microsoft .NET technologies, and we have specific accelerators for targeting Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) technologies in the Azure stack.

Xigadee is now open-source; released under the Apache 2 license. You are free to use it within your own commercial applications without restriction.

### Packages

Xigadee is made up of a number of distinct NuGet packages, which are listed below. They support different areas of Microservice functionality. These capabilities can be added to your project through the relevant [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Tags%3A%22Xigadee%22) packages. Currently Xigadee is in a pre-release state, but we are working to complete the documentation, and improve the code test coverage, so that we can provide a base line set of releases.

* [Xigadee](Src/Xigadee.Platform/_Docs/Introduction.md) 
	- This is the core library that is used to create Microservice and serverless based solutions.
