Xigadee is a Microservice framework, developed by [Paul Stancer](https://github.com/paulstancer) and [Guy Steel](https://github.com/guysteel) at Hitachi Consulting. 

The libraries are designed to provide a simplified and consistent approach to building complex scalable cloud based applications, particularly those targetting PAAS technologies, and using a Microservice-based serverless approach.

The framework is built using Microsoft .NET technologies, and has deep integration in to the Azure technology stack.
