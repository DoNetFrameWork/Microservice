Xigadee is a Microservice framework, developed by [Paul Stancer](https://github.com/paulstancer) and [Guy Steel](https://github.com/guysteel) at Hitachi Consulting. The framework has been in development for a number of years, and is based on our experience - and more importantly our pain - in building large-scale distributed cloud applications for our clients. 

The libraries are designed to simplify, and provide a consistent approach to our consulting teams, in building modern applications that target Platform-As-A-Service (PAAS) technologies. 

Xigadee is now open-source, released under the Apache 2 license, and you are free to use it within your own commercial applications without restriction. It is built using Microsoft .NET technologies, and has deep integration in to the Azure technology stack. 

## Introduction

To get started, please read the links below. These will give you an understanding of how we have put Xigadee toghther, and how you can use it in your software projects.
