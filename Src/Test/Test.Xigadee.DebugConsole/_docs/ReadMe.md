# Test.Xigadee.DebugConsole

This project is a console application that is used to spin up set of interlinked Microservice applications using the chosen communication protocol, such as Azure Service Bus.
It serves as a test bed for more complex functionality that can't be easily replicated using standard Unit testing.

To run this application, you will need to pass valid configuration credentials in the Command Line arguments to your own subscription.

## Getting started


## Switches

You can pass all your required settings in the app.config file. However this may be persisted to your code repository and you may not wish such sensistive information to be stored where is can be seen by anyone with access to your source code.

For this console application, you have the option to pass individual parameters in through the console switches, 
or pass in a SAS key to a table storage collection which can be shared across multiple developers.
